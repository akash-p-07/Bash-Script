If statements (and, closely related, case statements) allow us to make decisions in our Bash scripts. 
They allow us to decide whether or not to run a piece of code based upon conditions that we may set. 
If statements, combined with loops (which we'll look at in the next section) allow us to make much more complex scripts which may solve larger tasks.

Types: 
     1. Indenting
     2. Nested If statements
     3. If else
     4. If Elif else
     5. Boolean operations
     6. Case Statements
