A data stream in the context of Bash is a communication channel between a program and the environment where the command was launched from.

There are three data standard streams that are created when a command is launched.

The three streams are:

stdin - standard input
stdout - standard output
stderr - standard error
Further more:

The standard input stream accepts text as it's input.
The text output from the command is sent to the shell though the standard output stream.
Error messages from the command is sent to the shell through the standard error stream.
These data streams are treated as files meaning you read from them and write to them as if they are regular files. Files are identified by a unique number called a file descriptor, which the process uses to perform read/write operations.

When a command is launched, the first three file descriptors are allocated for the standard streams in the TTY. A TTY is the input/output environment, which is the terminal. This is different than a shell, which refers to the command-line interpreter.

Standard stream file descriptors:

0: stdin
1: stdout
2: stderr
File descriptor 0 is dedicated for standard input, 1 for standard output, and 2 for standard error.

File descriptors are maintained under /proc/$pid/fd where $pid is the process id. The current process can be referenced by /proc/self/fd.

The locations of these file descriptors are in /proc/self/fd/0, /proc/self/fd/1, and /proc/self/fd/2 respectively.
