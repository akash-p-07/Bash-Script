Bash uses a tool called positional parameters to provide a means of entering data into a Bash program when it is invoked from the command line. 
There are ten positional parameters that run from $0 through $9, although there are ways to hack around that limit.

Starting with a simple script that displays an entered name on the screen. 
Create a file called script1.sh with the following content and make it executable.

ex: 

#!/bin/bash
echo $0

The output from this script is the name of the script. 
The $0 parameter is reserved and predefined as the name of the running script and cannot be used for any other purpose. 
This can be handy inside a script because you don't need to pass the script its own name if it requires it.

ex: file name - myscript.sh

#!/bin/bash
echo "You entered the argument: $1, $2, $3 and $4"

Run>> ./myscript.sh Linux Pizza Books Games
O/P>> You entered the argument: Linux, Pizza, Books, Games.
