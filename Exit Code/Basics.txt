>>Every Linux or Unix command executed by the shell script or user, has an exit status.
>>The exit status is an integer number.
>>For the bash shell’s purposes, a command which exits with a zero (0) exit status has succeeded.
>>A non-zero (1-255) exit status indicates failure.
>>If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it returns a status of 127. If a command is found but is not executable, the return status is 126.
>>All of the Bash builtins return exit status of zero if they succeed and a non-zero status on failure.

example:

#!/bin/bash
# set var 
FILE="/etc/hosts"
 
# get host name 
read -p "Enter a hostname : " hostname
 
# try to locate hostname/computer name in $FILE
grep -q -w "${hostname}" "${FILE}"
 
# store exit status of grep
# if found grep will return 0 exit status
# if not found, grep will return a nonzero exit status
status=$?
 
if test $status -eq 0
then
	echo "Host '$hostname' found in $FILE file."
else
	echo "Host '$hostname' not found in $FILE file."
