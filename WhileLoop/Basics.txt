The bash while loop can be defined as a control flow statement which allows executing the given set of commands repeatedly as long as the applied condition evaluates to true. 
For example, we can either run echo command many times or just read a text file line by line and process the result by using while loop in Bash.

There are some key points of 'while loop' statement:
    - The condition is checked before executing the commands.
    - The 'while' loop is also capable of performing all the work as for 'loop' can do.
    - The commands between 'do' and 'done' are repeatedly executed as long as the condition evaluates to true.
    - The arguments for a 'while' loop can be a boolean expression.


>> Working - The while loop is a restricted entry loop. 
            It means that the condition is checked before executing the commands of the while loop. 
            If the condition evaluates to true, the set of commands following that condition are executed. 
            Otherwise, the loop is terminated, and the program control is given to the other command following the 'done' statement.
