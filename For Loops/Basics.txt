Like any other programming language, bash shell scripting also supports 'for loops' to perform repetitive tasks. 
It helps us to iterate a particular set of statements over a series of words in a string, or elements in an array. 
For example, you can either run UNIX command (or task) many times or just read and process the list of commands using a 'for loop'.  

Example:

#!/bin/bash  
#This is the basic example of 'for loop'.  
  
learn="Start learning from Javatpoint."  
  
for learn in $learn  
do  
echo $learn  
done  
  
echo "Thank You."
