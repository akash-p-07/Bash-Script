The Bash case statement is the simplest form of IF-THEN-ELSE with many ELIF elements. Using the case statement makes our bash script more readable and easier to maintain. 
These are generally applied to simplify the complex conditions having multiple different choices.

The Bash case statement follows a similar logic as the Javascript or C switch statement. There is a slight difference, as follows:

The Bash case statement takes a value once and tests that value multiple times. 
It stops searching for a pattern once it has found it and executed the statement linked with it, which is almost opposite in case of the C switch statement.

There are some key points of bash case statements:

>>Each case statement in bash starts with the 'case' keyword, followed by the case expression and 'in' keyword. 
The case statement is closed by 'esac' keyword.

>>We can apply multiple patterns separated by | operator. The ) operator indicates the termination of a pattern list.

>>A pattern containing the statements is referred to as a clause, and it must be terminated by double semicolon (;;).

>>An asterisk symbol (*) is used as a final pattern to define the default case. It is used as a default case when used as the last case.
